Dog-Fighter
===========

Dog-Fighter. CS 4455 final project of group The Adjectives.

Space dogfighter. Simple game; nothing too complex.

The way the game runs is action based. All things are split into separate scenes that run actions. Actions run the game and the point is that no two actions are strongly connected. They can communicate with one another via messages, and the idea behind them is that you can nest actions into one another.
